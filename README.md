## Why

I've wanted to study Svelte for some time now, but I didn't have any project for it. I play Sudoku a lot, and even with good apps I didn't found one with the settings I needed (like disabled error messages).
<br />
<br />

## Developed with

- âœ… Svelte/SvelteKit
- âœ… Typescript
- âœ… Tailwind
  <br />
  <br />

## Inspired by

**ðŸ‘‰ [https://sudoku.com](https://sudoku.com):** A great website I always use to practice.

**ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/robatron/sudoku.js](https://github.com/robatron/sudoku.js):** This repository gave me the board creation algorithm. It helped a lot.
